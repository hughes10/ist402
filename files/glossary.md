Write a paragraph explaining the term below, including 2-3 relevent links to more information about the topic.

## Front end Developer
A front end developer works on "front end" code in an application, commonly meaning the code that customers and product users interact with directly. A "front end dev" will typically write CSS, HTML and JavaScript in order to build complex interfaces for people to use. The front end development stack is always changing but tends to involve a front end library like Angular, React, Vue or Web components and a lot of backend knowledge in "tooling" like yarn / npm.

## HTML
When creating a website, HTML is a good language used on web pages. HTML elements is a type of code that made up of different sets of characters. They can also be called as tag. They usually defined as a starting tag which also has an ending tag at the end of the code, and the code between at is the main component of creating the website. HTML elements can have attributes and content, which can be headings, paragraphs, links, lists, embedded media, or any other format.
	HTML elements can placed into two different groups: block level and inline level. The former makes up the document's structure, while the latter dress up the contents of a block. In addition, Block elements occupy 100% of the available width and have a newline character before and after. Inline elements will only take up the space needed.

HTML, also known as Hypertext Markup Language, is a popular coding language that communicates directly with a web browser to display text, images, and other multimedia to a webpage. HTML works on all major web browsers, as well as mobile web browsers. In order to tell a browser how to format and organize content, HTML tags can be used. These tags contain attributes enclosed within brackets, which can be further explained in the links below. 

When using HTML, it is somewhat difficult to convey an aesthetically-pleasing design. For this reason, many programmers will also incorporate CSS, known as cascading stylesheet. This language can assist HTML in making cleaner, more easy-to-understand designs. One common argument regarding HTML is the usability of this programming language. When designing simple websites, HTML is quite useful and can perform most tasks with relative ease. However, on a larger scale with more complex designs, the incorporation of CSS is somewhat needed. I feel that most programmers need some common knowledge of HTML, but when it comes to designing large projects HTML can become quite tedious to code.

## CSS
Cascading Style Sheets are used when designing interesting webpages. By using CSS, the style of HTML elements can be changed, altering the design, structure and layout of the webpage. A web designer can use CSS to create a font, add color, change the positioning, edit pictures and create a whole new style on the page. Instead of writing the same inline styling for each element in HTML, a developer can link a CSS stylesheet which enables the entire website to be rendered the same way, with the same design. This also allows for creating a responsive design where the webpage changes based on the screen size. This is important when designing for PC vs mobile viewing.

## JavaScript
JavaScript is a commonly used, object-oriented scripting language which allows a user to input complex features onto a webpage. It is written onto an html page and can help your webpage include interactive maps and displays, animated graphics, timely content updates and many more things. Javascript responds and reacts to mouse clicks and keyboard inputs and has access to the Document Object Model, which gives Javascript the capability to read and change text, images and other attributes of a webpage.

Like Java, Javascript also falls from C and C++ and shares some syntax similarities to Java, however, they are two different languages. Javascript allows for immediate feedback for users as a user does not have to refresh to see updates and also allows for increased user interactivity. Some disadvantages of Javascript include not having any multi-threading or multi-processor capabilities. Other disadvantages include client-side Javascript does not allow the reading of files and networking applications cannot use this language.

## NPM
NPM or Node Package Manager consists of three distinct components. The first is the website, which is used to discover packages, set up profiles, and manage other ascepts of npm. The second is the Command Line Interface or the CLI, which is also called npm, and can be used to download and install software.

Lastly, it is the world's largest software registry. As a software registry, it contains over 800,000 code packages that open-source developers use to share software. It is also a software package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js.

## Package Manager
A package manager, or package management system(PMS), is a set of software tools that automate the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing computer programs from a computer operating system in a consistent manner. It mainly deals with packages and are often connected to Unix environment like Linux. Some examples of package managers could be Red Hat Package Manager(RPM), Yellowdog Updater(YUP) , and Modified(YUM). 

RPM: Red Hat Package Manager. Red Hat used it and its primary use is to install RPMs, which you have locally, not to search software repositories. The package manager named up2date was created to inform users of updates to packages and enable them to search remote repositories and easily install dependencies. However, some community members felt that up2date has some major drawbacks. 

YUP and YUM: Yellowdog Updater and Yellowdog Updated, Modified. YUP was created by folks at Terra Soft Solutions in 1999-2001, and then Duck University improved upon it by creating YUM which was popular now.

## Markdown
Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML.[9] Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.

## Git
Git is a version-control system (VCS) that's used for tracking changes to a source code or to any changes in a set of files during software development. This tool allows for better coordination among programmers, such that projects with various types of source code can be distributed speedily, accurately and consistently. In relation with GitHub, Git serves as the foundation for this service, and Git can even be used without this service. 

While using Git, a user can even use the command line to do various actions. Every Git command starts with the use of the code 'git'. From there, users can clone a project, push a branch, merge a branch and delete a branch. Of course, there are even more commands we can use, and the development of this tool is increasingly strong given the fact that it is open-sourced.

## Content Management System
A Content Management System (CMS) allows for the creation and management of content on website without the need to be a developer. This allows other people in a company such as a marketing team to post content to the website without having to know how to write HTML and without the risk of changing the layout of the site. A CMS also allows permissions to be given so multiple people who need to access the site for different reasons don’t always have access to the same content.

Some of the most used CMS’s are Drupal and WordPress as they have built a reputation for being very reliable and feature rich. Overall a CMS can make running a website a lot simpler than just using HTML and CSS from scratch and it allows for easy editing of content.

## Drupal CMS
Drupal is a free, open-source content management system (CMS) written in PHP and released under the GNU General Public License. It is free to download and users around the world can monitor underlying code for compliance and security issues, as well as fix them easily and quickly. It's used by millions of people and organizations around the globe to build and maintain their websites, for example: Tesla, The Economist, Harvard, etc.

## WordPress CMS
A Content Management System (CMS) is a type of software that helps users in managing and creating digital content. WordPress is an open-source CMS-based system that allows users to create customized blogs and websites. Being an open-source platform, WordPress has a multitude of developers that constantly update and add new features for free. Sites can be hosted on the WordPress server, or can be downloaded onto personal web hosts. 

The level of customization is what makes the platform so sucessful. Users can design a site using preinstalled themes and templates (no programming experience required), or create a site from scratch using PHP on a Linux or Windows OS. A vast amount of plugins can be installed into a WordPress site, such as SEO tools, security features, eCommerce solutions, among many others.

## Gulp.js
Gulp.js is a toolkit available for JavaScript that helps to streamline the building process and allows the automation of menial tasks often found within repetitive front-end development. It works by using Node.js streams to pass data through connected plugins.

Typically much of the time dedicated to front-end development ends up being used for repeated processes like removing small statements or needing to adjust a word for each line of code. Solutions would involve having your own build process that will do the boring work for you, or utilizing a task runner. That’s where gulp comes in, being a plugin that will act as that task runner, and allowing users to easily get past the busy work and move onto the bigger projects with their time.

## IDE
IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. This software is used to debug, compile, and run the code. It is a software that can build applications that combines common developer tools into a single graphical user interface. IDE’s can support one or multiple languages of code. IDLE is an IDE that only supports python code. Visual studios, once downloaded the correct language, can support multiple languages.

## VSCode
VS Code, or Visual Studio Code, is a cross-platform (uniform environment) source-code editor, released in April 2015 by Microsoft. It is free for both commercial and private use, and is available for Windows, Mac and Linux. It’s source code is open source. It is based on the Electron framework (developed by GitHub).The editor is Microsoft’s Monaco. It is praised for being “lean, customizable, and fast.” It is a very popular editor, having [2.6 million monthly active](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/11/16/connect) users in 2017.

It supports many common languages such as JavaScript and CSS. Even more languages can be found through extensions (Through the VSCode marketplace). These extensions range in functionality from adding a new theme to sharing code in real-time (Live Code extension). VSCode is extremely customizable in this way. The program also features built-in git (commit from the editor) as well as IntelliSense and debugging (Node.js). Other features include syntax highlighting, code refactoring, and bracket matching.

## Web Components
Web components are a set of features that provide a standard component model for the Web allowing encapsulation and interopability of individual HTML elements. This allows for for the expansion of HTML elements essentially. The purpose of this is to create your own elements using a web platform set of API's or Application Programming Interface. This makes it much easier for people to create a website. 

Resources that make it easier to build websites include: 1. HTML imports which makes it easier to import HTML documents into other documents, 2. HTML Templates which allow you to create sections of the DOM(Document Object Model), 3. Shadow DOM which encapsulates Javascript and CSS so it can be separate from the rest of DOM, and 4. Custom Elements which are API's to build your customized HTML elements.

## LitElement
 The word that I decided to research is LitElement. LitElement is used for making new web components and sharing the UI with your organization. It uses lit HTML which only re-renders the dynamics of a UI and hence the DOM updates are very quick. The good part about lit element is that it works with any standards you desire to implement because it follows the standards of the web components. Lit element will add API for managing the attributes and properties.

## lit-html
lit-html is an efficient, expressive, and extensible HTML template library for JavaScript. It provides all the features of JavaScript, a functional programming model, and contains whatever you need. lit-html is highly customizable and extensible, and it is very fast because it has a fast platform feature with local cloning, and lit-html updates only the parts of the template that need to be changed, not the entire view. lit-html is like your own template building kit.

lit-html does not rely on any component model, it only focuses on creating and updating the DOM. lit-html allows you to write HTML templates in JavaScript using template text with embedded JavaScript expressions.

## Open Source Software
Open Source Software is a type of computer software in which the source code is released under a license that the copyright holder contains the rights to study, change, and distribute the software openly. The reason that open source code is different that it will not hold the user to signing a licensing agreement. The authors of open source software make the source code availalbe to users that wish to code, copy, learn, alter, or share the original source code. The diverse opinions that open source software can provide has proven to benefit companies. In a 2008 report by the Standish Group, it states that the adoption of open source software models has resulted in the savings of about 60 billion per year for consumers. LibreOffice and the GNU Image Manipulation Program are examples of open source software.

## Apereo Foundation
In 2012, Jasig and Sakai Foundation merged together to establish Apereo Foundation. Apereo Foundation is a non-profit United States organization with an objective of making open source computer programs for use in advanced education conditions. Originally known as Jasig, it was founded by a group of IT personnel in 1999. Jasig is an acronym for "Java in administration special interest group". The programs are mostly written in Java and utilizes a community model. There are several institutions, affiliates, and partners associated with Apereo Foundation. 

Apereo Foundation carries an array of projects within many communites. For example, Apereo OAE is a new project which supports multipile institutions at the same time.

## TravisCI
Travis CI is service used to build and test software projects that are hosted on Github. The <b> CI </b> in TravisCI stands for continious integeration, the practicce of merging developers code to share a main codebase together. Travis CI has provided a testing base for over 900,000 open source projects. The following list is large software companies that trust Travis CI's work;
* Zendesk
* Engine Yard
* Heroku
* BitTorrent
* Moz

The software pipeline that Travis CI follows is the following; <i> push code to github --> Travis CI is triggered by Github to start a build of the project --> Travis will run the project through a series of tests --> If the build passes, Travis CI will deploy the application to Heroku --> Travis CI will then automatically send out a message to infom the software team that the build was successful. </i>

## SEO
[SEO](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451184?hl=en) stands for “search engine optimization.” It is the primary way to get traffic from the “free,” “organic,” “editorial” or “natural” search results on search engines. Google ranks webpages and websites that will be listed first on search results, by the meta tags that are listed on indivudual webpages. Companies put relevant name tags on their webpages that searchers may be interested in.

SEO is the magic you have to work on your article in order to make Google very likely to list your post as one of the top search results whenever someone searches for that keyword. Some marketing experts often specialize in SEO because it is vital for businesses to have proper meta tags on their webpages, in order to be on the top of the google results, which usually brings in more traffic, which ultimately helps the business grow. 

### Reasons companies pour so much money into SEO and understanding SEO:
- To get new people directed to their site
- Helps company make money
- Builds brand recognition
- Keeps company relevant amongst competitors

## Express.js
Express is the most popular Node web framework. Express.js is a web application framework that helps organize a web application into a MVC (Model, View, Controller) architecture on the server side of the application. To go even further, a developer can use MongoDB with Mongoose (for modeling) to provide a backend for the application. Express.js helps manage everything, from routes, to handling requests and views. Express also provides methods to specify what function is called for a particular HTTP request (GET, POST) and methods to specify what template ("view") engine is used.

## Bootstrap (design library)
Bootstrap is a free open-source CSS framework for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. This front-end component library allows users to utilize prebuilt components in a responsive mobile-first environment. In other words, mobile-first means it prioritizes mobile users needs before desktop users and adjusts intuitively to different device dimensions. This library contains typography, buttons, navigation, etc. 

Bootstrap is one of the most collaborated repositories on GitHub. It's the sixth highest starred repository with over 138,000 stars. It has excellent documentation which allows developers to explore its latest updates and features. Bootstrap is known for its ease of use while providing great results. Many companies chose to use Bootstrap for their front-end components such as Twitter, Spotify, and Udemy.

## React

React is a JavaScript library that is most prominently used for building interactive user interfaces for websites and applications. React was created in 2011 by Jordan Walker, a software engineer at Facebook, and the library was implemented into the company’s newsfeed the same year and Instagram’s the subsequent year. Facebook didn’t release React as we know it to the public until May of 2013, but ever since then it has been an open source software maintained by thousands of individuals.

Prior to the creation of React, developers had to essentially create user interfaces from scratch. This system was inefficient and it increased the risk of coding errors. Code within the React library is reusable and accessible to all, which effectively decreases development time and risk of programmer error. One of the major features of React is that developers can make large changes to their user interface components without reloading entire pages worth of content. This is most helpful when creating dynamic websites, where user interaction with the page is prominent. For some cool examples of sites that were built atop React, check out Netflix, Reddit, Dropbox, Facebook, and many more!

## Vue.js

Vue.js (pronounced the same as ‘view’) is a progressive Javascript framework used for developing user interfaces. Designed to be adoptable, Vue's basics are relatively easy to understand and can easily be integrated into existing projects and libraries. Vue enables developers to extend HTML and HTML attributes with directives, special tokens in markup that indicate how the library should handle certain Document Object Model (DOM) elements. Directives can be built-in or user defined.

Vue is similar to React in purpose, but each have different pros and cons. Ease of integration is a common praise for Vue and a less strict learning curve is also a relevant bonus. Vue was created by one man named Evan You and has always been open-source, relying heavily on community support. He created Vue to combine features from already popular frameworks like React and Angular.

## Golang
Go also known as "Golang" is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google. Go is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP style concurrency. There are two major implementations to Golang. Google’s self hosting compiler tool chain targeting multiple operating systems, mobile devices, and web assembly. A third party transpiler, GopherJS, compiles Go to Java Script for front-end web development. 

Go was designed at google in 2007 to improve programming productivity in an era of multicore, networked machines and large codebases.

## SQL

SQL Is known as Structured Query Language. The main purpose of utilizing SQL is the idea of  communicating with a database. SQL is known as the standardized programming language for relational databases. The primary funtions of SQL are selecting, inserting, updating, creating and dropping data within the database set. SQL also functions as a data retrieval tool that can take subsets of data in the database for transactions, processing, analytics and optimizing applications databases.

## MySQL

MySQL is an open source relational database management system (RDBMS) with a client-server model. RDBMS is a software or service used to create and manage databases based on a relational model. MySQL allow clients to connect to a server through a network. The client can make requests to the server using a graphical user interface (GUI). There are a lot of GUIs that support MySQL. Some of the most popular GUIs are MySQL WorkBench, SequelPro, DBVisualizer, and the Navicat DB Admin Tool.

Using a desired GUI the server, then, fulfills the request as long as both client-server understand the instruction. In simplified terms, MySQL  creates a database for storing and manipulating data then allows clients to use SQL statements to make requests allowing the server to provide the required information. The simplicity of MySQL makes it easy to use while offering high performance as it is able to tore wide array of data. In addition, MySQL has a high security level making it attractive to larger companies. The final link below gives an idea of some of the companies that use MySQL.

## WebAssembly
WebAssembly is an open standard that defines a portable binary code format for executable programs, and a corresponding textual assembly language, as well as interfaces for facilitating interactions between such programs and their host environment. The main goal of WebAssembly is to enable high performance applications on web pages, but the format is designed to be executed and integrated in other environments as well.
WebAssembly, or WASM for short. WebAssembly is a small, fast binary format that promises near-native performance for web applications. Plus, WebAssembly is designed to be a compilation target for any language, JavaScript being just one of them.

## Python
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

Python is a rising star in the programming world for two main reasons: the big range of tasks it can handle, combined with the fact that it’s actually a very beginner-friendly language. Python code syntax uses English keywords, and that makes it easy for anyone to understand and get started with the language.

## Docker
Docker is a basic tool that allows you to control the application’s operating system by using containers. A container isolates or contains the code and operating systems of the applications. They keep everything organized as you can choose how to isolate the different apps. This enables you to run all of the containers on the same host, which makes it easy to run your software no matter where you are. A software called Kubernetes, made by Google, can help you manage all of your containers. Businesses use Docker to reduce inoperability of their systems and make it easier to move to different clouds when working with multiple vendors.

## Vagrant
Vagrant is an open source software for building and maintaining portable virtual software environments. It can be used with VirtualBox, KVM, Hyper-V, Docker containers VWware, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). It simplifies the software configuration management of virtualization in order to increase development productivity. It is written in Ruby but it supports development in a few different languages. It can be download for free on HashiCorp’s website.Vagrant was first started as a personal side-project by Mitchell Hashimoto in January of 2010.

## VirtualBox

Virtualbox or also known as Oracle VM Virtualbox is a free and open-source software for x86 and AMD64/Intel64 computing architecture virtualization. Virtualbox is a powerful product that is made for enterprise use as well as home use. Virtualbox can create a virtual machine by acting as a hypervisor and allows the user to run any operating system. Virtualbox provides a high level of features and performance for the customer of the enterprise available as Open Source Software.

Virtualbox runs on several operating systems such as Windows, Linux, Macintosh, and Solaris by hosting/supporting several amounts of the guest operating system. Overall, Virtualbox is a software that allows users to use an operating system on their own computer and get the experience of using it like it is actually on the real hardware system.

## Composer
Composer is a dependency management tool for PHP 5.3 and above. It allows you to declare the code libraries on which your project depends, and it will install them for you in your project. Composer is not a package manager. Yes, it involves "packages" and "libraries", but it is managed on a per-project basis and installed in a directory of your project (such as vendor). It does not install anything globally by default. So this is just a dependency management.

Suppose you are creating a project, you need a library that outputs logs, and you decide to use the monolog library. In order to add the monolog library to your project, just create a composer.json file, the contents of this file describe the project's dependencies. Examples are: {"require": {"monolog / monolog": "1.2. *"}}

## Kubernetes / K8s
Kubernetes(K8s) is a container management PaaS(Platform as a Service). K8s uses what's called clusters which are
made up of virtual machines (VMs) that each do specific tasks as either a master or a node. These nodes is a host
for one or more containers. These containers contain applications and the master VM communicates with the nodes on
whether to create or destroy nodes or to reroute traffic between nodes. 

The reason to use Kubernetes is because it's faster than other methods, cheaper than other methods, 
and much more efficient than other methods. Kubernetes offers virtually infinite scalability and access anywhere
as either an on-premise, hybrid, or public cloud infrastructure. The downside to K8s is that is requires other
projects to function at full efficiency. In order to take advantage of everything Kubernetes has to offer it needs:
- Registry
- Networking
- Telemetry
- Security
- Automation
- and other services dependant on the task at hand.

## Accessibility / A11y
A general definition of accessibility, or “A11y”, is a product or service that is obtainable easily. The term “A11y” was coined by The A11y Project to promote accessibility across websites. As technology expands, accessibility is very important because users need to have convenient access to things like websites, apps, etc. 

Another function of accessibility is the focus on treating people equally. Accessibility accommodates people with disabilities to have the same experience as everyone else. As a result, accessibility improves usability, avoids discrimination and legal complications, builds positive public relations, and creates a better search engine optimization (SEO).

## Internationalization / i18n
Internationalization is a design process that allows a product to be very flexible and diverse by designing it so I can be used across multiple countries or designing them so they can be easily modified when they arrive in different places. Internationalization allows for users across the world to be able to use products that are unchanged across countries. 

Making products that can be consumed across various countries require conforming to different countries technical needs. By doing this there will be a large amount of opportunities that will open up. It will allow for some gaps in cultures and countries to bridge. Even though it will be used in many different countries and places the source code will remain the same, which definitely saves a lot of headaches.

## User Experience / Usability
User Experience refers to the design process. Usability plays a key role in improving UX. User Experience refers to a person’s feelings about using a particular product including functionality, branding, and comparisons to the psychological expectations. UX is based off of satisfaction, enjoyment, pleasure, and value it brings to a user. This is a broad and holistic view of a IT product or system.

Usability is a measurable indicator for IT systems and products. This refers to the degree of effectiveness, ease of use, and efficiency for the consumers. Usability includes effectiveness, efficiency, learnability, memorability, and error prevention. Usability is a more narrowed and focused aspect of UX. Usability is an important role in making a good UX; the easier and more effective an IT product or system is, the more pleasant experience a user will have, thus a higher UX.

## Nginx
NGINX is a new emerging web server that is becoming the most popular web server in the world. NGINX is a high performance web server, it outperforms apache when loading static web pages. It can be used as load balanceer, mail proxy, HTTP cache, web server, and a reverse proxy. NGINX was created as an open source project in 2004. NGINX is build on a programming language called C. Igor Sysoev was the original creator of NGINX, he wrote it to solve the C10K problem, this is a problem that still exists today, this problem is when web servers have trouble handling large numbers of concurrent users.

The main goal of NGINX was to create the fastest web server around and using this as the central goal of the project. NGINX is typically used as a load bolancer as well, which means NGINX can manage high volumes of traffic and distribute this traffic to optimize webserver clusters performance levels. It also is typically used as a reverse proxy, you can think of this as a proxy for servers, not clients. 

Here are some helpful websites that can provide furthur details and infomation about NGINX. <br />

## Apache Web server

Apache is a popular open-source web server, also known as the most popular web server in the modern world. It is run by Apache Software Foundation. The Apache web server basically can let everyone to collaborate and the developers can create their modules to support the function that they want to have and make the core feature much better.  

The job of the Apache web server is allowing clients to ask the requites and the server would accept and respond to it. Moreover, Apache has different kind of modules which can have more function than other web servers. For example, multi-processing modes, SSL, and PHP. Therefore, the main goal of the Apache is to communicate over networks from the client to the server using TCP/IP protocol, such as HTTP/S.

## Varnish
Varnish is a web HTTP accelerator that was created for websites that have are very content heavy. A web accelerator is a proxy server that reduces web access times. This means that more people are able to access things on the web at a higher rate and a faster speed. Unlike other web accelerators, Varnish does this by reducing contention between threads to a minimum. Being heavily threaded, Varish can create new threads when prior ones are overworked to continue giving a heavily-accessed content more access without users experiencing interruptions. Varnish is completely linked to HTTP and can only be used on that specific protocol. 5% of the top 10,000 websites use Varnish. Some of those websites are Facebook, Twitter, The New York Times and Wikipedia. 

Varnish was a project that was created by the Norweigan newspaper “Verdens Gang” and was led by architect Poul-Henning Kamp. It began developing under the company of Linpro but quickly grew large enough to turn into its own company, Varnish Software. 

Here are some more sources to help better understand Varnish and how it works.

## Webpack
It is a module bundler primarily for JavaScript, but it can transform front-end assets like HTML, CSS, and images if the corresponding loaders are included. Webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules. Webpack can take care of bundling alongside a separate task runner. However, the line between bundler and task runner has become blurred thanks to community-developed webpack plugins.

## OpenFaaS
OpenFaas is designed to assist developers deploy event-driven functions and microservices to Kubernetes, an open source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Function as a service is a category of cloud computing services that provides a platform for customers to develop, run, and manage application functionalities. 

Any process can be packaged as a function enabling developers to consume a range of web events without repetitive boiler-plate coding. OpenFaas can be run anywhere using a public or private cloud, build both microservices and functions in any language, and auto-scale for demand or to zero when idle. The main concept of OpenFaas is that anything can be packaged into a serverless function.

## PaaS
The word that I decided to research was PaaS. Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model in which an external source can provide hardware and software components concerning development. PaaS does great in virilization environments and application development. PaaS specializes in building platforms as a service. This is one of three components of cloud computing (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS).
Some companies that use PaaS every single day are AWS, Google App Engine, VMware (Dell), Salesforce and Microsoft Azure. All these companies believe in the virtualization of a system. By allowing a service to go virtual and be used on any system, it allows them to attract more customers and make more money in the long run. Below I attached three articles I enjoyed about PaaS and how it helps a business in the long run.

## SaaS
SaaS stands for Software as a Service and in its most simplest terms, it allows users to connect to and interact with cloud-based applications over the internet. This option differs from downloading and owning the software on your machines whereas with SaaS you are most likely on a subscription based payment system that renders you a temporary license to access the application.

A Lot of new advantages have come to light with this type of service and more and more businesses are operating and switching to SaaS platforms. They’re less stressful to setup and maintain than in-house software downloads/updates, accessible outside the office and you only pay for what you use so scaling a business is more efficient. CRM, HR and Procurement have seen the most significant increase in usage. While the SaaS has some much upside there are a few drawbacks that could hinder your experience. Data security and access (speed of delivery) are both out of your control when dealing with a SaaS because the data is stored offsite you hope the provider has taken the proper steps to safeguard your information. The access rate can depend on both your internet connection and also the functionality of the servers on the providers side.
